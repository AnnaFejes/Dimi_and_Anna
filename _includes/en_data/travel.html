                <p class="text-muted">While Plovdiv has an airport (PDV), WizzAir & Ryanair only fly there from London (Luton & Stansted) every week on a Tuesday, Thursday & Saturday and usually super pricy compared to other airports. The next nearest airport is SOF in Sofia. British Airways, Bulgaria Air (both from London Heathrow), WizzAir (from London Luton) and Ryanair (from London Stansted, Birmingham & Edinburgh) flies there directly from the UK. Other, alternative airports are BOJ in Bourgas and VAR in Varna, both close to the sea. WizzAir serves both from London Gatwick & Luton, and Jet2.com serves Bourgas from various airports</p>

                    From Sofia
                    <br>
                    To Plovdiv: from Sofia (& SOF Airport) take the „Тракия“/E80 highway to Burgas (marked as A1 on Google Maps) - the exit to Plovdiv is roughly around an hour away from the capital. From here it depends on where you go within the city.
                    <br>
                    To directly to the venue: after taking the above exit, join onto road 805 which, which will turn into 86 after the roundabout (this road takes you around Plovdiv). Turn off at the interection to Markovo - here it gets a bit tricky. Within the village of Markovo there is a left turn where the proper asphalt road ends going forward & there are some markings in Bulgarian but nothing in latin letters, however all signs say to go left & the asphalt continues to the left. After leaving Markovo, if you encounter two hairpin bends - you are on the right road. Continue on this road until an intersection with road 8604 - you will not be able to continue ahead, you either can turn left or right according to road markings. Please turn right. This road is a mountain road, in the forest, and after leaving the intersection, there are no houses or buildings for a while and you should pass another three hairpin bends - when you reach the next place with buildings and a visible electicity pole on the right, turn left. Immediately after turning left, there is a little place to eat - traditional Bulgarian. For another 2 there isn't anywhere to turn left on this road, but the first option is a locked gate, the second will have a wooden sign for Forest View, turn left here. The road quality significantly drops after this turn, if you miss it. After 350 meters, the road ends in a fork - on the left there is a barrier, that is our venue.
                    <br>
                    There are no tolls for highways, but a vignette is required - if you are renting a car that should be included, but if not you can buy these online on https://www.bgtoll.bg/en/.
                    <br>
                    Speed limits: 50km/h within built-up areas, 90km/h outside built-up areas, 130-140km/h on motorways, depending on signage.
